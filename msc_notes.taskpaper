meetings:
	170508:
		- lock for code for golchi 2014 monotone emulation  @done
			none from google; something on her personal site but not exactly
		- priors can determine whether the answers you get out are sensible (not really bayesian but whatever)
		- can use sample unscaled variance of the observations to decide how to distribute variance across different parts of the model. i.e. say certain amount on physics model, some on discrepancy, some on random error
		- scaled random walk just needs to be a symmetric distribution
	170512:
		- GP = regression with correlated errors
		- just accept that the derivative of a GP is a GP
		- can choose GP correlation function such that a GP can approximate non-differentiable stuff
			- still need knowledge of what the function should look like or lots of samples though
		- standardise data... might be close enough GP
	170519:
		- matern because of numerical stability (also reviewer was an ass) compared to squared exponential
			- squared exponential can lead to to cov matrices with columns that are too similar => computer issues (rounding error), i.e. it things the matrix is not positive semidefinite
			- read the welch paper black box blah blah
				- something about a nugget so that the numerical instability can be fixed
		- yes if hastings ratio numerator/denom too close to zero, can log both sides
	170601:
		# weird length-scale parameter from mcmc
			recall length-scale l shows up as sqrt(5) / l
			but then it's really hard to have a justifiable prior => transform it so that instead of getting exp(-sqrt(5) / l * distance), we have P^(distance) 
				i.e. variable transformation so instead of support(l) > 0, we have support(P) \in (0, 1)
				easier to put a prior on P than l
		# "parameter" choices
			you include (y*, y') as parameters in the posterior only when you know which new inputs where you want prediction
			typically you don't know this so the posterior is just a function of the GP parameters 
			for Golchi 2014 EX1. you do know y*, y' etc. so it's fine to include it in the posterior
		# mcmc output
			so you've done MCMC and have chains for the GP parameters
				look at the histograms to see the distributions!!
			the correct way to get sample paths is to 
				1. sample from posterior dis. for each parameter
					it might be ok to use a point estimate based on your MCMC chain IF the distribution of the parameter is unimodal with small variance
						DB prefers posterior median instead of the posterior mean because it's unlikely that the distribution should be symmmetric
					sometimes if it's hard to get a distribution of the GP parameter i.e. you didn't explore the space a lot etc. maybe use the posterior mode
					i.e. if you use a point estimate to get your GP sample paths this way, then you're not accounting for any of the variability on your GP parameters
						consider a CI vs. a prediction interval
				2. use the sampled parameters to sample from the MVN appropriately 
						(apparently the mean and covariance formulas [y* | y, GP parameters] are the kriging equations)
		# numerical instability in the matern covariance
			recall: can fix via the nugget, or the (A + t(A) ) / 2 trick; however...
			## don't use the solve() or inv()
			- look up the cholesky decomposition (i.e. gives S^-0.5)
				or QR decomposition?
				recall SVD can give eigenvalues for non-square matrices
			## build your on sampler from the MVN distribution
			i.e. the package one probably sucks
			- build your on sampler from the MVN distribution
				1. sample y where yi ~ N(0, 1) independently
				2. S^-0.5 y = y', where y' ~ N(0, S)
			## squared exponential vs. matern
				consider that squared exp is basically a more strict constraint on the function space
					because squared exp is infinitely differentiable
				matern only has a few derivatives that exist so it is a more relaxed constraint
					=> using the matern leads to fewer numerical instability issues
		# range of problems
			recall in Golchi 2014 EX1, the x ranges from (0, 1)
			apparently this is quite standard (i.e. even for vector x, all x_i range from 0, 1) 
				remember i can be thought of as an index for some covariate value, hence some of the GP parameter are like a regression coefficient
				https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/277176/gaussian-process-and-correlation
			since the standardisation just ends up in the GP parameters for example it gets absorbed by the length-scale parameter 
		# acceptance rate
			- email DB about JASA paper (Todd Graves, JASA tuning MCMC)
			- check EX1. and make those plots for some initial values; 
				given initial value, x-axis = step-width for proposal, y-axis = acceptance rate
				- report to DB aiming for 30-40%
		- do the SMC finally
