\title{Second derivative correlation matrix}
\usage{
matsecder(x, y, l, h, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Matrix whose each row is a point in \code{R^D}}

\item{y}{Matrix whose each row is a point in \code{R^D}. The number of columns must be
the same as the number of columns in \code{x}.}

\item{l}{Vector of length scale parameters for each input dimension. Length of \code{l} must
be equal to the number of columns of \code{x} and \code{y}}

\item{h}{The dimention with respect to which the first derivative is taken.}

\item{k}{The dimention with respect to which the first derivative is taken.}
}
\value{
Correlation matrix between points in \code{x} and \code{y}.
}
\description{
\code{matsecder} returns second derivative of the correlation matrix between two
sets of points given by the
matrices \code{x} and \code{y} for a given length scale parameter \code{l}.
